# Thinkfulbnb

Thinkfulbnb is a vacation rental website that allows people to rent out their homes to people who are seeking short-term accommodations in that locale. Thinkfulbnb hosts rent out different kinds of properties, including single rooms, apartments, and unique living spaces such as yachts, houseboats, yurts, tiny houses, and even renovated medieval castles.

This project was completed as part of the Thinkful curriculum for a Software Engineering Immersion program.
Starter code was provided and students are tasked with implementing appropriate media queries for a responsive design with a mobile first approach.  Students are asked to use flexbox, use a responsive navigation, and appropriate input types for the forms.
